## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability go
to [Advisories section](https://github.com/utox39/oh-my-update/security/advisories) or contact this email address:
francescomoccaldi39@gmail.com

1. Describe the vulnerability.

    * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, etc.)
    * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
    * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
    * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
    * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
    * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
    * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

2. If you have a fix, that is most welcome -- please attach or summarize it in your message!

3. I will evaluate the vulnerability in a controlled environment and, if necessary, release a fix or mitigating steps
   to address it. I will contact you to let you know the outcome, and will credit you in the report.

4. Please DO NOT disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is released!

Once I have either a) published a fix, or b) declined to address the vulnerability for whatever reason, you are free to
publicly disclose it.
